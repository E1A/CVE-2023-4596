# Summary
A severe vulnerability has been discovered within Forminator, which enables an unauthorized attacker to upload arbitrary files to the targeted server. The initial proof of concept (PoC) was poorly written, the original researcher shared a few unclear screenshots along with a request containing unexplained code. So I developed a Python script for it.

The vulnerability is caused by an error in the validation process for file types. When attempting to upload a prohibited file format, such as PHP, an alert is generated stating that the "Uploaded file's extension is not allowed." Despite this notification, the uploaded file is not blocked; rather, it is successfully uploaded and can be accessed within the "/wp-content/uploads" folder of the site. This vulnerability has the potential to lead to remote code execution.

Forminator is currently active on more than 400,000 sites, and with the simplicity of the vulnerability, it is quite easy to gain control over any site running Forminator.

# Usage
Find a page running Forminator <= 1.24.6 with an upload function on the page. Copy the full URL and generate an [interactsh](https://app.interactsh.com/) link, files will be uploaded in /wp-content/uploads/[current year]/[current month]/file.php. 
After a succesful upload, a request should appear in interactsh within 5 seconds, indicating it is vulnerable. The code can be easily modified to get code execution, but to prevent people from misusing the PoC, I've only made an intrusive way to confirm a vulnerable instance.
