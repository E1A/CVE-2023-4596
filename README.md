# PoC
Find an page running Forminator <= 1.24.6 with an upload function on the page. Copy the full url and generate an interactsh link, files will be uploaded in /wp-content/uploads/[current year]/[current month]/file.php. After an succesful upload, the script will activate the script and an request should apair in interactsh within 5 seconds indicating, its vulnerable. The code can be easily modified to create an RCE but to prevent skiddies from misusing the poc, ive only made an intrusive way to confirm an vulnerable instance.

```
user@debian:~$ python3 exploit.py -u http://127.0.0.1:8000/?p=7
Input interactsh link: <input interactsh link>
